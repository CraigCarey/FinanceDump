# Fund Types

### CEIC (Closed-End Investment Company)

- A type of investment fund that raises capital through an initial public offering (IPO) and issues a fixed number of shares.
- The shares are traded on stock exchanges, similar to stocks.
- The fund is professionally managed, and the portfolio can include stocks, bonds, or other assets.

### Investment Trust

- A type of closed-end fund specific to certain jurisdictions, particularly the UK.
- It operates similarly to a CEIC but is structured as a company that issues shares to investors to fund its portfolio.
- Investment trusts are considered a subcategory of closed-end investment companies.

### Unquoted Investments
- An unquoted investment refers to a financial investment in securities or assets that are not listed or traded on a formal stock exchange.
- These investments are often privately held and lack the visibility, regulation, and liquidity of publicly traded securities.
