You will have to use some of the python skills you've seen in class and look back at the examples to help figure out how to proceed. \n","\n","I've given you a lot of help, though. And to help things further, we are going to use a very familiar situation: a Multples valuation. \n","\n","This is different from Multiples as you are probably used to them, though. I have downloaded data for every single firm traded on US exchanges (as of March 2021). We are going to use a \"big data\" approach to identify undervalued firms by considering all of them and focusing solely on financials to identify comparables. \n","\n","Step 1: Data cleaning. There is a lot of missing data and perhaps confusing data when we obtain a big dataset like this. We need to figure out what to do with it. \n","\n","Step 2: Filtering to get a comp set. We'll use filters in python to identify firms that are undervalued. The idea is to \"hold all else equal\" by gathering a set of firms with similar financials (margins, growth, ROIC, etc.) and then choose the lowest multiple in the group. This firm should be undervalued. The highest multiple firm is overvalued. \n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"cell_id":"3b9152c0606d4ea0858d5d3d06f7a3ef","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"deepnote_cell_type":"code","deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"executionInfo":{"elapsed":123,"status":"ok","timestamp":1631903822067,"user":{"displayName":"Jesse Blocher","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"12887429221220358574"},"user_tz":300},"execution_millis":1968,"execution_start":1637534636868,"id":"1VMyP9SaY2pX","outputId":"a7399460-809c-4ad0-806a-d39702c3e59a","source_hash":"bbd98b5c"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["3.8.10 (default, Nov 14 2022, 12:59:47) \n","[GCC 9.4.0]\n"]}],"source":["# start by loading in our typical set of packages\n","import numpy as np  # NumPy\n","import pandas as pd  # pandas\n","import seaborn as sns\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","\n","import sys\n","print(sys.version)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"cell_id":"f12f87bb67884d52a29d5dbb07de2198","deepnote_cell_type":"code","deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"execution_millis":5830,"execution_start":1637534638848,"source_hash":"20bd38bc","tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Requirement already satisfied: xlrd in /home/craigc/personal_workspace/FinTech/api_eval/openbb/openbb-venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages (2.0.1)\n"]}],"source":["# use pip to install the package 'xlrd'\n","# need it to read the excel file below\n","!pip install xlrd\n","import pandas as pd\n","df = pd.read_excel"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":13,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <th>5</th>\n","      <th>6</th>\n","      <th>7</th>\n","      <th>8</th>\n","      <th>9</th>\n","      <th>...</th>\n","      <th>29</th>\n","      <th>30</th>\n","      <th>31</th>\n","      <th>32</th>\n","      <th>33</th>\n","      <th>34</th>\n","      <th>35</th>\n","      <th>36</th>\n","      <th>37</th>\n","      <th>38</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc.

selling Daily Journal Corporation (NasdaqCM:DJCO) and Cara Therapeutics, Inc.

Poor performing companies were in the bottom quartile of EBITDA, profit margin, profit, roc, and EBITDA margin, within the entire dataset. Daily Journal has an EV/EBITDA multiple of 95.87, the fourth highest in the poor performing quartile – indicating a high valuation with comparatively low EBITDA. Furthermore, as a news publishing company operating on a regional basis, we see strong industry headwinds of full digitization as an obstacle to company growth (CFRA Equity Research: DJCO, 11/20/21). Cara Therapeutics has an EV/EBITDA multiple of 201.06, the second highest in the poor performing quartile. We see the same trend here as we do with Daily Journal Corporation, only more exacerbated. Additionally, recent company news reports revealed abnormalities for patients involved in their clinical trials for Oral KORUSVA (Company Press Release: CARA, 4/29/21). Specifically, we believe that the company faces inconsistent growth, in addition to poor operating and return on investment margins (Argus Research Report: CARA, 11/10/21).

We selected these companies because they have a relatively lower (hence healthier) EV/EBITDA multiple, while also they are high performing so we would recommend buying those stocks. The division of EV by EBITDA gives a good measure of value. It estimates the number of years in which the business will repay its acquisition cost to the buyer through its earnings. Merck&amp;Co has an EV/EBITDA multiple of 11.35, the 13th from the end in our data frame. This indicates that although it's not at the top of the high performers group, it's still considered to be a buy since it has a good EV/EBITDA compared to the firms in it's industry. Nvidia has a high EV/EBITDA multiple of 60.36, which should be encouraging to a potential investor due to previously discussed positive performance implications. This is the highest multiple in the top performing companies and represents a company with ample room for future growth. Nvidia is an artificial intelligence company with promising future earnings expectations based on our multiple analysis. Following the pandemic chip storage, the demand for Nvidia's chips for self-driving cars sky rocketed. The company is looking to expand chip supply to other industries such as healthcare and entertainment. (Investor's Business Daily: NVDA, 11/18/21).
